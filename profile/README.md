# Welcome to the ECA/SAE Project

This organization is the central hub for the development of the Entity & Compute Attestation (ECA) and Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocols, along with their reference implementations and supporting materials. 

## Repository Guide

This organization houses several key repositories:

* **[ECA internet-draft](https://github.com/eca-sae/internet-draft-eca)**: Entity & Compute Attestation (ECA), an application layer attestation protocol
* **[SAE internet-draft](https://github.com/eca-sae/internet-draft-sae)**: Static Artifact Exchange (SAE), a stateless, pull-only transport layer protocol
* **[ECA/SAE prototype](https://github.com/eca-sae/prototype-eca-sae)**: A working, end-to-end proof-of-concept demonstration the ECA/SAE protocols orchestrated with docker compose, based on the original -00 specification of ECA & SAE.

Discussion, feedback, and contributions are welcome as we work to build a more secure foundation for the modern cloud.
