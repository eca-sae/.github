# Welcome to the ECA/SAE Project

This organization is the central hub for the development of the Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA) and Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocols, along with their reference implementations and supporting materials. The goal is to create a robust, open, and secure foundation for machine identity bootstrapping in modern cloud environments.

## Commitment to Open Standards

The **ECA** and **SAE** protocols are being developed as open standards and have been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for community review and standardization.

This GitHub organization serves as the primary home for these efforts, as initial stewards for the technology. This project fully supports the IETF's mission and community-driven process. To that end, should an official IETF working group be formed for these protocols, a transfer of the `internet-drafts` repository to an official IETF-managed location may follow, to ensure its vendor-neutral, long-term success.

## Repository Guide

This organization houses several key repositories:

* **[internet-drafts](https://github.com/eca-sae/internet-drafts)**: The canonical source for the formal protocol specifications and their supporting ProVerif models.
* **[prototype](https://github.com/eca-sae/prototype)**: A working, end-to-end proof-of-concept demonstration the ECA/SAE protocols using docker containers, designed for developers who want to see the system in action.

Discussion, feedback, and contributions are welcome as we work to build a more secure foundation for the modern cloud.
